# HR_Analytics_Presence_Insights

## At-a-Glance ðŸ‘€
This project analyzes three months of employee attendance data to uncover insights into work patterns and preferences. Key findings reveal that Mondays have the highest presence rate, while sick leave peaks on Fridays. Recommendations include optimizing work schedules and implementing flexible work policies to support remote work trends. Additionally, tasks in Power Query Editor were automated to ensure scalability and efficiency in data processing.

# Problem Statement

The project aims to combine three months of employee attendance data to gain insights into the distribution of work-from-home versus work-from-office days. Including trends such as the preference for working from home on Mondays or Fridays, and understand the possible reasons behind these patterns. Additionally, the project will calculate monthly and weekly attendance percentages and analyze sick leave patterns to help implement preventative measures and improve workplace policies.
